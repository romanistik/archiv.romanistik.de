<p>Job summary: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Linguistics Center of Lisbon University is seeking to appoint two post-doctoral research fellows in Computational Linguistics. Both positions have a maximal duration of five years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Job description:</p>
<p>Universidade de Lisboa   |   University of Lisbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Linguistics Center of Lisbon University is seeking to integrate in its SKAi (Sources, Knowledge and Modelling) group two post-doctoral research fellows, specialized in Computational Linguistics or Computer Science to develop and improve new and existing resources combining NLP and statistics.</p>
<p>Researchers should have three years of postdoctoral experience (in exceptional cases, candidates with less than three years of research experience might be considered).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research members of SKAi are committed to deal creatively with primary sources (for instance through archive searching or field work) and to produce major collections of secondary sources, as a means to identify, record, preserve and analyse varieties of European Portuguese beyond its standard and contemporary use. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLUL has thus established itself as a leading research center on usage-based studies, which started in the 1970s with its work on dialectological resources and on a corpus of spoken Portuguese.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These lines of resource collection and analysis cover large and diversified fields, focusing mainly on: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Portuguese philology (Textual Criticism and Historical Linguistics): diplomatic and critical editions of literary and non-literary texts (of all periods, with focus on modern literary autographs), on-line archive of Portuguese Private letters (17th-19th c.) and electronic corpus of Occitan Poetry; </p>
<p>- Portuguese language, its European dialects and varieties: large-scale corpus of Contemporary European Portuguese with 350M words, dialectal corpora, comparable corpora of Portuguese varieties, tagged and/or parsed corpora, lexicons, relational databases and atlases; </p>
<p>- Specialized corpora of Portuguese, with special interest for the study of terminology;</p>
<p>- Comparable spoken corpora of Romance languages and contrastive studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These large language resources (LR) provide data not only for theoretically-oriented linguistic research at CLUL but also for national and international linguistic communities, through online access at the CLUL webpage or through publishers/distributors, such as John Benjamins or ELDA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qualified development of these resources and improved standards of presentation and availability require an interdisciplinary team, involving linguists, computational linguists, computer science experts and a strong knowledge of statistics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work to be accomplished by the 2 post-doctoral fellows aims at implementing new and imaginative infrastructures for the existing LR, which should converge toward new applications and paths for corpus-based approaches and primary sources exploitations. The ultimate goal is to attain international high-quality standards in this field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work involves tasks such as:</p>
<p>&gt; Developing human language technology applications, including market research and evaluation, planning, overseeing activities related to development and programming </p>
<p>&gt; Developing an integrated infrastructure for large-scale resources and other corpora and lexicons, assuring their availability; </p>
<p>&gt; Participation in customizing, further developing and creating linguistic relational databases; </p>
<p>&gt; Establishing automatic processes of information extraction for metadata corpus management, such as summarization and automatic topic detection; </p>
<p>&gt; Development and maintenance of parallel corpora (including alignment tools and the adaptation or development of a web search engine for parallel corpus exploration), comparable corpora of Portuguese varieties and specialized corpora; </p>
<p>&gt; Application of statistical NLP tasks, such as assessing corpus similarity, extracting neologisms through corpus comparison, extracting multiword expressions and terminology and assuring evaluation measures; </p>
<p>&gt; Integration in the LR infrastructure of  semi-automatic processes for corpus compilation through the web; </p>
<p>&gt; Development of corpus annotation systems. </p>
<p>&gt; Development and maintenance of tools for automation/support of linguistic tasks. </p>
<p>&gt; Creation, maintenance, and enlargement of machine-readable lexicons and dictionaries. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These tasks require strong programming skills (essentially Java and Perl), a good knowledge of databases like MySQL, and preferentially, a good background in both linguistics and computational linguistics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Required skills:</p>
<p>Ph.D. degree in Computational Linguistics or in Computer Science</p>
<p>strong background in computational linguistics  and linguistics (preferential)</p>
<p>knowledge about Natural Language Processing and corpus-based methods</p>
<p>experience with statistical NLP techniques</p>
<p>demonstrated proficiency in Portuguese (preferential) and in English </p>
<p>programming experience (Perl or Python tool development. Java, C++)</p>
<p>good working knowledge of SQL and Visual Basic or other relevant data manipulation/programming languages.</p>
<p>familiarity with available Portuguese-language linguistic resources (corpora, morphological analysers, grammars/parsers etc.) (preferential)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a closer description of the overall research and the different research groups of the center, consult <a href="http://www.clul.ul.pt/" target="_blank" >www.clul.ul.pt</a></p>

<p>Job summary: </p>
<p>A five-year job for a post-doc researcher specialized in experimental linguistics. Objectives: integration of research in theoretical and experimental linguistics (namely within speech and language processing, language development and the interfaces between syntax, phonology and language processing); development and advancement of experimental techniques to be used in current lines of research and new projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Job description:</p>
<p>Universidade de Lisboa   |   University of Lisbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Faculty of Letters of Lisbon University is broadly based, interdisciplinary and internationally oriented. The faculty offers courses and conducts research in languages and cultures of Western, Central, Eastern and Southern Europe, history, archaeology, art history, performative and visual arts, literature, philosophy, communication, translation and media studies, as well as African and Asian studies. Graduate courses are strongly interweaved with research centres, and graduate students amount to one third of the Faculty students. </p>
<p>The Centre of Linguistics (CLUL) is committed to theoretical, theoretically oriented, descriptive and experimental research leading to novel (gap-filling) contributions to linguistic analysis, targeting both adult and child grammars, as well as language processing. Presently, the Centre includes a Psycholinguists Lab and a Phonetics Lab, and several lines of research within Experimental Linguistics are being developed. In particular, the integration of research in theoretical and experimental linguistics is a central objective for present and future research, which necessarily calls for the strengthening of the research team in the area of Experimental Linguistics. This strengthening is crucial to several developing lines of research and research projects, namely within speech and language processing and the interface between syntax, phonology and language processing. Among the research questions being pursued, we highlight the following: the role of frequency and grammar in online lexical access/word detection; implicit prosody, syntax and language processing; early language development (word segmentation, phonology, syntax) approached namely via perception studies with infants and babies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLUL thus offers a postdoc position in Experimental Linguistics. The researcher will set up and test hypotheses addressing the questions mentioned above, among others of interest to the research team. Experimental methods may include word spotting, lexical decision, eye-tracking, distributional learning, head-turn preference procedure. Another important aim is the development and advancement of experimental techniques to be used in current lines of research and new projects. The researcher will be actively collaborating with current research projects, and involved in the supervision of Masters and PhD students, as well as in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of research data. It is also expected that the researcher will set up a project in the areas of interest just described, thus contributing to the central objectives of the team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applicants should have a strong commitment to internationally-recognized research and demonstrated capacities as an independent researcher, especially in the form of journal publications. The successful candidate should have a background in an experimental linguistic discipline, such as psycholinguistics, speech perception, language development, or experimental phonology. Some knowledge of Portuguese is desirable, but not required. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Application’s documents (in English):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications (by regular mail or by e-mail) should include (i) a letter of motivation, (ii) a curriculum vitae, (iii) copies of degree certificates, (iv) copy of an identification document, and (v) a minimum of two letters of recommendation or two contacts of qualified specialists who may recommend the candidate. Please send two publications plus PhD dissertation. </p>

<p>Job summary:</p>
<p>A five-year job for a post-doc researcher specialized in prosodic variation. Objectives: to study of prosodic variation in European Portuguese (prosodic phrasing, intonation, rhythm); to set up a project conducing to an Interactive Atlas of European Portuguese Prosody and Intonation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Job description:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Universidade de Lisboa   |   University of Lisbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Faculty of Letters of Lisbon University is broadly based, interdisciplinary and internationally oriented. The faculty offers courses and conducts research in languages and cultures of Western, Central, Eastern and Southern Europe, history, archaeology, art history, performative and visual arts, literature, philosophy, communication, translation and media studies, as well as African and Asian studies. Graduate courses are strongly interweaved with research centres, and graduate students amount to one third of the Faculty students. The Centre of Linguistics (CLUL) is committed to theoretical, theoretically oriented, descriptive and experimental research leading to novel (gap-filling) contributions to linguistic analysis, as well to making available to the scientific community new language resources such as corpora, databases and tools that may significantly contribute to linguistic and multidisciplinary research. Understanding language variation has been a long-standing objective within CLUL. However, the study of language variation has only very recently targeted prosodic variation, both within CLUL and elsewhere. The inspection of the prosodic properties of local varieties of European Portuguese is thus largely to be done. Therefore, questions like how the organization of speech into chunks varies across Portugal, what intonation patterns are used in the different regions, or whether speech rhythm contributes to regional varieties remain to be answered. Research on prosodic variation is of central interest to language typologies, to grammatical studies (in particular due to the syntax-prosody and morphology-prosody interfaces), to speech and language processing (as prosody as been shown to constrain processing), to language development (via the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis), to language pathology (prosodic impairments, in particular), to speech technologies (recognition and synthesis systems), as well as to other areas of research that interact with linguistics, namely language teaching, literature, history, anthropology, ethnography, or sociology. CLUL is engaged in developing this area of research, by addressing prosodic variation within a program of international scope that proposes a system for prosodic transcription and labelling of speech corpora, together with a set of methodological procedures that enable cross-linguistic work on prosodic variation in language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLUL offers a postdoc position in Phonology, Phonetics and Language Variation. The researcher will set up a project conducing to an Interactive Atlas of European Portuguese Prosody and Intonation, freely accessed online. Data collection for prosody and intonation survey will follow the procedures established in recent similar projects for other European languages (such as British English or Catalan). Data processing will make available new resources for further in-depth studies of Portuguese prosody and related applications. The researcher will be actively collaborating with the members of the research team committed to the study of prosody, and involved in the supervision of Masters and PhD students. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applicants should have a strong commitment to internationally-recognized research and demonstrated capacities as an independent researcher, especially in the form of journal publications. The successful candidate should have a background in the phonetics and phonology of prosody. Experience with tonal labelling (ToBI) is welcome. Some knowledge of Portuguese is desirable, but not required.  </p>
