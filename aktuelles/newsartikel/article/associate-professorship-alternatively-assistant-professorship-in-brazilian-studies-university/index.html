    <p>The Department of English, Germanic and Romance Studies, Faculty of Humanities, the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, invites applications for an associate or assistant professorship in Portuguese with a focus on Brazilian studies to be filled by the 1st of April, 2013, or as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successful applicant must document research in Brazilian studies with a focus on one or more of the following areas of research: history, social studies, cultural studies and literary studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The undergraduate and graduate programs in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies are located within the Department of English, Germanic and Romance Studies, which currently employs approximately 150 members of staff. The department teaches and conducts research into language and linguistics, history, literature and society in Western Europe, Latin America, Australia, the USA, Canada and parts of Africa. We offer a dynamic environment with a high level of personal interaction and a wide range of tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Job content</p>
<p>The undergraduate program in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies is being restructured and will reopen in September 2013. The new program takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the Portuguese-speaking world, integrating theories and methods from the humanities and social sciences, so as to provide a broad analytical base for tackling real-world problems and communicating results effectively. In fact, nearly half of the undergraduate courses in the major will be taught using a problem-based perspective, so the successful applicant will be expected to use this method in specific courses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The B.A. program additionally includes courses which focus on the Portuguese-speaking world as a whole. Thus, the successful applicant must be able to teach and supervise broadly in the subjects at this level. Furthermore, he/she will be expected to contribute to the restructuring and development of the M.A. program in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department also houses the Center for Latin American Studies, whose purpose is to foster collaboration between researchers working within the areas of Latin American history, sociology, politics, anthropology, language and linguistics, and literary studies. The successful applicant will be expected to make significant contributions to the center, both in teaching and research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The position is open to applicants at both the associate and assistant professor levels. An applicant who successfully meets the criteria for an associate professorship will be at an advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An associate professorship is a permanent position. The associate professor is expected to be able to take part in all the activities of the Department, including examinations and administration and also manage research projects, provide pedagogic supervision, supervise assistant professors and sit on academic assessment panels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An assistant professorship is a three-year, fixed-term academic position involving research and teaching. The person appointed to the post will be obliged to complete a course in university teaching devised especially for assistant professors, and is expected to be able to take part in all the activities of the Department, including examinations and administration. At the end of the three-year period, provided the appropriate funding is secured, a post of associate professor will be advertised for which the assistant professor may apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The selection criteria are set out below under the qualification requirements.</p>
<p>Potential applicants are welcome to contact the program coordinator for information regarding the new curriculum and additional information about the position: Associate Professor Sandi Michele de Oliveira, smo@hum.ku.dk. General enquiries may also be submitted to acting Head of Department, Dorte Albrechtsen (doralbr@hum.ku.dk ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qualification requirements</p>
<p>The ideal candidate:</p>
<p>? Has a PhD focusing on Brazilian society or culture</p>
<p>? Has native or near-native fluency in Portuguese</p>
<p>? Has a strong publication record focused on Brazil</p>
<p>? Has a record in attracting external research funds and/or working on research teams</p>
<p>? Is able to teach BA-level courses which incorporate knowledge of other areas of the Portuguese-speaking world</p>
<p>? Is able to teach courses which are cross-disciplinary in nature</p>
<p>? Has experience in problem-based learning/teaching and in team-teaching</p>
<p>? Is able to teach first-year classes in either Danish or English</p>
<p>? Has had administrative experience at the university level</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applicants whose PhD research centered on another area of the Portuguese-speaking world may be judged qualified for this position, if they present academic publications on topics of contemporary Brazilian society and/or culture as well as a research plan covering the next three years which includes substantive work on Brazil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applicants must document complete fluency in written and spoken Portuguese. Knowledge of the other languages taught at the department will be an advantage, as the successful applicant will be encouraged to take part in interdisciplinary collaboration in the department. Concerning English, see paragraph below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to be able to take part in daily communication and administrative duties at the department, non-Danish speakers must acquire the necessary Danish language skills within a maximum of two years. In order to function in the department until these qualifications are acquired, good English language skills in speech and writing are expected and should be documented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
